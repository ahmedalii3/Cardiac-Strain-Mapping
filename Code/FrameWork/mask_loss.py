class MaskLoss(Loss):
    """
    Custom Keras loss function that applies a mask to the loss calculation, allowing for selective weighting of regions in the input.
    This loss is designed for tasks where only certain regions of the input (as indicated by a mask) should contribute more heavily to the loss, such as in image segmentation or deformation field estimation.
    Attributes:
        Inherits from the Keras `Loss` class.
    Methods:
        __init__(**kwargs):
            Initializes the MaskLoss instance. Accepts additional keyword arguments for compatibility with Keras configuration.
        call(y_true, y_pred):
            Computes the masked mean squared error loss between `y_true` and `y_pred`.
            Args:
                y_true (tf.Tensor): Ground truth tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, 3], where the first two channels are the target values and the third channel is the binary mask.
                y_pred (tf.Tensor): Predicted tensor of shape [batch_size, height, width, 2].
            Returns:
                tf.Tensor: Scalar tensor representing the masked mean squared error loss.
            Details:
                - The mask (third channel of y_true) is used to focus the loss on specific regions.
                - The loss is weighted by the ratio of masked to unmasked pixels to balance the contribution of each region.
                - The squared error is computed only for the first two channels.
                - The mask is expanded to match the shape of the squared error for element-wise multiplication.
                - The final loss is the mean of the weighted errors.
        get_config():
            Returns the configuration of the loss instance for serialization.
            Returns:
                dict: Configuration dictionary.
